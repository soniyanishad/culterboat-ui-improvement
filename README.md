Cultre Boat Website – UI/UX Improvement Proposal
Overview

As part of this assignment, I reviewed the Cultre Boat website and focused on improving selected sections from a user experience, visual design, and structural perspective. The goal was to enhance clarity, engagement, and modern usability while maintaining the brand’s creative identity.

Instead of redesigning the entire website, I chose to improve key user-facing sections that directly influence user perception and interaction.

Sections Improved
1. Hero Section
2. Services Section
3. Portfolio / Work Showcase
4. Contact Section
5. Navigation & Layout Structure

Improvements Implemented
1. Hero Section Enhancement
What Was Changed

Improved typography hierarchy
Added stronger visual balance between text and visuals
Introduced subtle floating animation for visual engagement
Simplified messaging for better readability
Added clear Call-To-Action button

Why It Was Changed?

The hero section is the first impression users get. The original layout had information but lacked strong visual emphasis and emotional engagement.

Expected Impact

Higher user attention
Improved brand storytelling
Better conversion through clear call-to-action
More professional and modern appearance

2. Services Section Redesign
What Was Changed

Converted services into structured card layout
Added hover interaction and smooth reveal animation
Improved spacing and readability
Introduced visual icons for faster understanding

Why It Was Changed?

The previous services layout lacked visual grouping, which made it harder for users to quickly understand offerings.

Expected Impact

Faster content scanning
Better visual hierarchy
Increased user interaction
Improved content clarity

3. Portfolio / Work Showcase Improvement
What Was Changed

Introduced grid-based layout
Added hover overlay for project details
Added image zoom interaction for better engagement

Why It Was Changed

Portfolio sections are critical for credibility. Enhancing visual interaction helps showcase projects more effectively.

Expected Impact

Improved project visibility
Higher user engagement
More immersive browsing experience
Better representation of company work quality

4. Contact Section Enhancement
What Was Changed

Improved form design with better spacing and accessibility
Added basic validation for better user feedback
Simplified form layout for faster completion

Why It Was Changed

Contact forms should be easy and intuitive. Poor usability in this section can reduce user inquiries.

Expected Impact

Reduced user friction
Increased lead generation possibility
Better accessibility and usability

5. Navigation & Layout Improvements
What Was Changed

Added sticky navigation for easier access
Improved transparency and modern styling
Enhanced mobile responsiveness
Improved content spacing across sections

Why It Was Changed

Navigation plays a key role in user flow and overall usability, especially on mobile devices.

Expected Impact

Improved usability across devices
Better navigation clarity
Enhanced mobile user experience

UX Improvements Summary

Enhanced interaction using subtle animations
Reduced visual clutter
Improved consistency across sections
Enhanced mobile usability
Performance Considerations

Assumptions Made
The primary audience includes brands and marketing clients.
Visual storytelling is important for brand positioning.
The website aims to showcase creative and marketing services.
Conversion through contact and portfolio viewing is a key goal.

What I Did NOT Change and Why

Core brand tone and messaging were preserved to maintain brand identity.
Content wording was not heavily modified to respect existing brand communication.
Overall section structure was retained to maintain familiarity for returning users.

Tools & Technologies Used

HTML

CSS (Modern layout and animation techniques)

JavaScript (User interaction and validation)

Expected Overall Outcome

The improved layout encourages users to explore services, view portfolio work, and engage through contact interaction.
